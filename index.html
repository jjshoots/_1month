      <h1>To My Rachel.</h1>

      <p>It’s been a month. And while we’re probably not the type to post long captions on Instagram, writing a few solid paragraphs just for you feels like the least I can do. I wish I could turn this analog in time - I'm still learning.</p>

      <p>I’m writing this while waiting for the AREX Express from Incheon to Seoul. It’s 8:08 AM, 21 May 2025 - almost exactly one month, minus 12 hours, since we became a couple. There are two things I want to say.</p>

      <p>First: thank you for letting me into your life, and for wanting to be in mine. For a long time - maybe forever - nothing has ever felt this right. You engage parts of my mind I usually turn off around others. Some have seen pieces of it. Very few have said, “You’re weird, I like you.” Fewer still have said, “How much weirder can you get?” Only you have said, “Let’s be weird together.” I love you. Thank you for giving me the space to be that person. Thank you for letting me experience you in your entirety.</p>

      <p>Thank you for also pushing me to grow. You make me think more deeply, act more intentionally, and stay present. You remind me to notice the little things - the smell of coffee, figurines in restaurants, cats on the roadside, strokes in a painting. You show me that noticing them isn’t just allowed, it’s necessary. Further, you remind me it’s deeply human to connect with those things - and to laugh. All this in spite of the bigger strides in life. In just a month, you’ve grounded what’s often felt like a drifting kite of a life. You make life feel _worth it_.</p>

      <p>Second: this is my vow - to you, to us, and to what we’re building. Whatever comes our way, I’ll do the work to make us work. As long as you’ll have me, I’ll love you and I’ll be here. We’ll argue - probably more times than we can fathom - but each one is a chance to understand us better. I’ll mess up. You’ll get mad. I’ll deserve it. And I'm sorry. But I’ll still be here, arms open.</p>

      <p>I know life feels heavy for you sometimes, and I know you worry it might be heavy for me too. But let me say this again: whatever we face, I’ll take it all - proud as a Pomeranian. Small, stubborn, but showing up anyway. “Van Gogh’s brilliance wasn’t because of his circumstances, it was in spite of them.” I want to be with you not because it’s easy, but because it’s you.</p>

      <p>I love you, truly.</p>
      <p>Happy one month!</p>
      <p>Here's to infinitely many more.</p>

      <p>Love, Jet</p>
